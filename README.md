# Modtool
A tool for quick access to your modding tools
The file is a self extracting Archive, just download it as a zip
and then double click the file called Modtool.sfx.part01.exe
The Modtool will auto run the first time, after that just
run it from the shortcut on the desktop, this is a work in 
progress.

Thanks to all the OG's for the files, ive not made any changes to any
of them except for Bin4ry modder tool to which he agreed.
