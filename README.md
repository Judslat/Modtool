The file is a self extracting Archive, just download it as a zip
and then double click the file called Modding tool setup.part01.rar
and extract the single file to desktop, run it and will install
the files needed

run it from the shortcut on the desktop, this is a work in 
progress.

Thanks to all the OG's for the files, ive not made any changes to any
of them except for Bin4ry modder tool to which he agreed, changes include 
an auto admin elevation and a request to choose which version you want, also
includes all the tools

All tools are owned by their respective creators, I have just assembled them 
into one easy to use interface

Changelog

V2 changed the layout and colours

V3 now includes Silencio software and a redesign
